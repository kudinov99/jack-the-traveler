                <p>Amsterdam is considered to be an expensive city even for wealthy tourists. A room in a 3-star hotel costs approximately $150. So, if you want to stay there for 3-4 nights, the travel will be quite costly. Plus, public transport is also really expensive. So, what a low-budget tourist should do?</p>
                <p>Well, first of all, don't get upset. Even with empty pockets, you still can get the most of Amsterdam.</p>
                <h2>So, where to live?</h2>
                <p>Why not to try Couchsurfing? It's a rather common option but it really works. Just register on the site and write to some of the hosts. It may happen that some of these people are busy or do not answer at all, so feel free to write many, many messages. The main thing is to honestly write about how many days you plan to stay, what kind of person you are, where you are from, you travel alone or with friends. Some hosts only provide you with accommodation, others gladly show you around the city.</p>
                <h2>What to see?</h2>
                <p>To make the first walk in the Dutch capital, it is not necessary to buy expensive sightseeing tours or include them for an extra charge in the tour package. Amsterdam, like other European capitals, can now be viewed for free using the offer of local enthusiast guides. The organization “City free tour” offers travelers two free tours: “City tour” and “Tour of the Red Light District”.</p>
